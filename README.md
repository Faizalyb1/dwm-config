# Quick Start Guide

**NOTE: You must have Xorg and a display manager installed for this to work. (I suggest lightdm). Also make sure you have fontawesome and firacode installed. (```yay -S ttf-fira-code ttf-font-awesome```)**

To install my DWM and configs, you will have to follow this guide.

First, clone the repository into /usr/local.
```
cd /usr/local && sudo git clone https://github.com/BigAnteater/dwm-config && cd dwm-config
```
Then run the installation script.
```
sudo chmod +x install.sh && sudo ./install.sh
```
Finally, restart your computer, and you will see a DWM option in your display manager.
